# Bank-Churn-Analysis-PowerBI-Project

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of bank churn data, focusing on understanding and visualizing the factors that contribute to customer attrition, also known as churn. In the banking industry, churn represents the customers who have left the bank within a specified period, a phenomenon often driven by various economic, personal, and service-related factors. Understanding these factors is crucial for banks as it helps them implement strategies to enhance customer retention and, consequently, improve overall profitability.

The dataset used in this analysis is a sample dataset designed for learning purposes, providing a rich basis for exploring report creation and conducting data analysis using Power BI. This dataset contains several variables that could influence customer behavior, such as customer demographics, account tenure, transaction history, and service usage patterns. By analyzing these variables, this project seeks to uncover key patterns and correlations that are likely to predict customer churn.
